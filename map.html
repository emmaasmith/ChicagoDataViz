        <h2>Intro: a Scrolling Data Investigation</h2>
        <p>Chicago politics are fascinating. The home of Obama, Chicago boasts a strong liberal base in the otherwise-conservative Illinois.</p>
        <p>In 2011, Rahm Emanuel won the nonpartisan mayoral election against Gery Chico and others with over 50% of the vote. </p>
        <p>Emanuel then served a controversial first term.</p>
        <p>In 2015, he sought office again in an election against Chuy Garcia and others. Emanuel couldn't rally a majority vote this time, forcing an unprecedented runoff against Garcia. Emanuel was elected.</p>

        <b>What caused this change? Or more broadly: what are the key predictors of Chicago voting behaviors?</b>

        <h2>Below, we will show <u>race</u> to be a leading factor in the 2015 Mayoral vote.</h2> 
        <b><br>We compare race to two alternative hypotheses: 
        <br><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> <u>(1)</u> Political ideology
        <br><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> <u>(2)</u> Policy support.</b>
        <br>
        <p>We use data from the: 
        	<li>2011 Mayoral</li> 
        	<li>2012 Presidential</li> 
        	<li>2014 Governor</li>
        	<li>and 2015 Mayoral</li>

      <div class="section"  id="s6">
        <h2>Hypothesis 1: Is political ideology the leading factor for voting behavior?</h2>
        <p>Did people vote against Rahm because he was too conservative or too liberal?</p>
        <p>Is race simply correlated with general conservatism?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section"  id="s7">
        <h3>There does appear to be a correlation between race and ideology.</h3>
        <p>In order from liberal to conservative: black, then Hispanic, then white voters.</p>
        <p>A plot of Governor and Presidential voters colored by race ought indicate a close correlation: upper left is most Democratic, while lower right is most Republican.</p>
        <div class="racekey">
        	<br><span style='color:#000000'>&#9724; Majority White</span>

        </div>
        <p>Let's see if this holds up with Mayoral data from the 2011, 2015 general, and 2015 runoff elections.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section"  id="s8">
        <h3>A. 2011 Mayoral election</h3>
        <p>We keep the Governor data on the X-axis, but swap out the Y-axis (from Presidential to 2011 Mayoral results). </p>
        <p>Pretty different! </p>
        <p><b>Votes are no longer tightly linked to conservatism, like before.</b></p>
        <div class="racekey">

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section"  id="s9">
        <p>Based on our race-ideology correlation, we expect black and white voters to continue to hold opposing views, with Hispanic voters in the middle.</p>
        <p>Instead, black (liberal) and white (conservative) voters <u>both prefer Emanuel</u>, while Hispanic (moderate) voters want Chico.</p>
        <p><b>Thus, the race-ideology correlation no longer applies.</b></p>
        <p>A compelling explanation is that white voters like Emanuel for his conservatism and race, while black voters trust him due to Obama's endorsement. The Hispanic voters prefer Chico, the Hispanic candidate.</p>

        <h3>B. 2015 Mayoral election</h3>
        <p>The same coaltion of black (liberal) and white (conservative) voters remains for the 2015 election data.</p>
        <p>From 2011 to 2015, the black and white votes drop. Likely, this is because Emanual has shown through his previous term to be conservative. The Obama endorsement has been weakened.</p>

      <div class="section"  id="s11">
        <h3>C. 2015 Runoff Mayoral election</h3>
        <p>The white votes stay lower than their 2011 levels. But the black votes increase as a group to approximately the same level as in 2011.</p>
        <p>If black voters chose based on political ideology, they'd prefer Chuy -- the liberal candidate.</p>
        <p>Instead, they return to Emanuel. The interpretation is that their candidate, Wilson, was removed, so they gave allegiance to Obama's candidate.</p>

        <h2>Hypothesis 2: Is local policy the leading factor for voting behavior?</h2>
        <p>Did people vote against Rahm because of his prominent policies?</p>
        <p>Is race just correlated with public opinion on Rahm's policies?</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of Emanuel's most discussed policies was, in 2013, closing 49 Chicago Public Schools.</p>
        <p>The public school closings were a controversial policy, as some claimed they disproportionately harmed underprivileged populations.</p>
        <p>The media suggest that school closings may have played some role in dissuading voters from supporting Rahm.<sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/us/politics/chicago-votes-on-giving-rahm-emanuel-a-second-term-as-mayor.html?_r=0">1</a></sup> Chuy even used the issue in his campaign.<sup><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/chicago-mayoral-race-school-funding_n_6939732.html">2</a>,<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/6/jesus_chuy_garcia_meet_the_chicago">3</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>We'd thus expect to see:</b> Non-white votes for Wilson supporting Chuy in the run-offs.</p>

		<p>I am aware that some factual errors exist; for instance certain schools' locations are listed incorrectly.
		<br>There are also some key approximations, such as that the 2011 precincts were different from the other data sets (I took data modeling that change from the sources listed on Github).</p>

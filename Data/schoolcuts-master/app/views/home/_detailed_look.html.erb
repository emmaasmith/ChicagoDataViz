<p>The following data helps better understand each school. </p>

<dl class="examples">

    <dd>
        <p>The percent of students meeting or exceeding state standards on standardized tests is tracked for one group, or cohort, of students from grades 3&mdash;8. This shows how a specific set of students performed over time. </p>
        <p class="mute"><%= I18n.t(:left) %>: <%= link_to 'King', school_path(59) %></p>
    </dd>
